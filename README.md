# PixelFrameLab

## A web app where you can edit small images pixel-by-pixel and have them animated in sequence.

## How to Use / Deploy

This is a static web application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, requiring no complex build steps.

### Local Development / Testing

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd PixelFrameLab
    ```
2.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. All necessary assets (CSS, JavaScript) are linked relative to this file.

### Deployment to a Web Server

To deploy this application, you need a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.) configured to serve static files.

1.  **Upload Files:** Upload the entire contents of the `PixelFrameLab` directory (including `index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`, and `TESTING.md`) to the root directory of your web server or hosting service.
2.  **Access:** Once uploaded, the application will be accessible via the URL configured for your web server (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/` or `https://yourusername.github.io/PixelFrameLab/`).

No special server-side configuration or dependencies are required.
